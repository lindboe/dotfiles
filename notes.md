# Blurry WSL and high dpi monitor
Apps can look blurry with an X server and a high DPI monitor. To fix, go to the
compatibily options of the X server program, choose "Change high DPI settings",
and click "Override high DPI scaling behavior". The application option seems to
work but honestly I don't understand what this does.
